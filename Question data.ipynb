    "# Question Data Tutorial\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to introduce some useful functions and show how to do typical tasks when working with quantitative educational data. This tutorial assumes you already have basic knowledge of Python and Pandas and have already completed the Exam data tutorial and/or mastered the skills in that lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn the following:\n",
    "* How recode variables to new values\n",
    "* Change the names of data frame columns\n",
    "* Wide vs long format for data frames\n",
    "* Concatenate and merge data frames\n",

    "There are two common formats to store data, the *wide* format and the *long* format. In the wide format, each variable has its own column while in long format, each observation has its own row, with the variable and its value as separate columns. So far, we have only worked in the wide format. Here, we will show how to convert between the two formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide format is probably how you will be working most of the time. However, long format can be useful depending on the task. If you have a lot of blank data (say there are four versions of the exam each with 10 questions and all of the versions are completely different from each other so each student only answers 10 of the 40 possible questions), long format can be a more efficient way to store data. That is, long format can also result in smaller file sizes if the long format equivlent would include a lot of missing data. This can be important if you are working with multi-GB size files or real-world data that is being added to in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's show how to convert between these and then an example of where long format can help."

    "Now, if we want to switch back to to wide format, it's pretty easy to do so. We use `pd.pivot` so convert from long to wide format. We specify the columns to stay the same in the `index` parameter. The column that contains all of the new column names we want is passed to the `columns` parameter and the column that contains all the values is passed to `values`. Notice that `var_name` and `columns` are the same variables and `value_name` and `values` are the same variables for `melt` and `pivot` respectively."
