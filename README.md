# Python-Intro

This repo contains tutorials for learning how to use Python to analyze typical types of educational data for the Georgia Physics and Astronomy Education Research group. It is assumed you have basic Python and Pandas knowledge already.

To get started, click the green `< > Code` button in the upper right of this page, followed by "Download Zip". Unzip the file and then launch Jupyter Notebook or JuypyterLab to view the files.

There are currently 2 tutorials in this repo. I recommend working through the "Tutorial - Exam data" first followed by "Tutorial - Question Data". Below are the skills you will learning in each:

* Tutorial - Exam data
  * How to sort and view data
  * Compute values from multiple columns
  * Compute values across a row
  * How to break results down by some grouping variable
  * How to extract a column from a data frame for use elsewhere
* Tutorial - Question data
  * How recode variables to new values
  * Change the names of data frame columns
  * Concatenate and merge data frames
  * Wide vs long format for data frames
  * Contigency tables
  * Hypothesis testing
  * Effect size
 

All data needed for these tutorials are included in the repo and were created specifically to show different types of analysis that can be done in Python. If you want to see how the data were generated, it is contained in "Data Generation (R)" file. Please note this file in written in R rather than Python.

If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please let Dr. Young know at nicholas.young <at> uga <dot> edu.
