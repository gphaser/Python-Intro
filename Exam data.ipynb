    "# Exam Data Tutorial\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to introduce some useful functions and show how to do typical tasks when working with quantitative educational data. This tutorial assumes you already have basic knowledge of Python and Pandas. It also assumes you are familiar with method chaining (e.g. `myobject.function()` ) as a way to reduce intermediate steps and make your code more readable.\n",

    "In this lesson, you will learn the following:\n",
    "* How to sort and view data\n",
    "* Compute values from multiple columns\n",
    "* Compute values across a row\n",
    "* How to break results down by some grouping variable\n",
    "* How to extract a column from a data frame for use elsewhere\n",

This file represents simulated exam scores for a course with three exams and is similar to what you might see if you were using the eLC gradebook for a project. Scores are between 0 and 100 but you'll notice most students did well on this exam. There is also a generic `group` binary variable that could represent something like female, underrepresented minority, first generation status, etc.\n",

    "Once we have it in this format, we can easily use `matplotlib` to create a chart with the error bars. I'll pick the error bars to be 1.96 times the standard error so that this corresponds to a 95% confidence interval. This means that if we collected this data in 100 similar classes and computed the confidence interval for each, 95 of the intervals would contain the true average score of all physics classes on the exam (assuming we are saying these classes are samples from the population of physics classes). I'll only add one of the exams here to keep things simple but we could plot all of the exams on the sample plot with a few extra lines of code.\n",

    "(Side note: the 1.96 number comes from the normal distribution. In a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the data lies within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean. This is often rounded to 2 as in the [68-95-99.7 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule). In PER, a difference greater than 2 standard deviations is generally the minimum for a result to be statistically significant. In particle physics, it is 5 standard deviations, often called $5\\sigma$ or 5 sigma. Here, if these 1.96 standard error error bars don't overlap, that suggests the performance difference between group 1 and group 2 is statitically signficant ($p<0.05$)."
